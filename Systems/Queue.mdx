# Getting Started

The queue system comes with a singular queue along with a leave part and a queue gui with the spot the player is in and a leave button. Make sure you follow the preparation step below.

## Setup

You must follow the one-step setup. Setting up for customization will be automatically done upon server creation, but it might be useful if you're customizing certain parts.

### One-Step Setup

<Danger>
  Important\! Not doing this will break your system\!
</Danger>

After you add the model, you will need to drag the gui named `ScreenGui `to` PlayerGui`. Everything else will work on its own. Make sure not to change the parent of everything else unless you want to get rid of the default system.

### Setting up for customization

If you want to customize your queues, you might want to make the following changes for more easy editing

- Move the `queues` folder to workspace if you're using the ready-made queue. This will allow you to see the queues and customize them. See [Customization](https://player.mintlify.app/Systems/Queue#3d-queue).
- Move the queue module to ServerScriptService. This will allow you to require the module and see all the functions and receieve auto-complete. See [Functions](https://player.mintlify.app/Systems/Queue#functions).

## Deleting the ready-made queue

The system has a ready-made queue which is all in the folder titled `queues` under the Module titled `queue`. To delete the ready-made system, simply delete the folder titled `queues.`

<Danger>
  Make sure you delete the entire folder titled queues. Not deleting it can cause errors.
</Danger>

## Creating more queues

To create a new queue in the ready-made system, just clone the existing clone titled `queue1` and change the clone's name. You can move it in any direction you please.

<Warning>
  Creating a queue with an existing name will cause an error and your new queue will not work.
</Warning>

## Customization

Customization for the queue settings, ui, and the 3D queue is quick and easy to use.

### Queue settings (Module)

The queue module allows you to set the maximum amount of players that can enter your queue, the cooldown before they rejoin, and the studs between each player.

To set these values while creating a queue, add a new table in the arguments in the `Setup` function. You don't need to include all 3 of these values, if you want to use default values, just put `nil` in the spot of the one you want to use the default for. See [Setup](https://player.mintlify.app/Systems/Queue#setup-2) for more information.

After creating your queue, you can adjust the customization values by using the `setCustomization`function with the queue name and a customization table just like the `Setup` function. See [setCustomization](https://player.mintlify.app/Systems/Queue#setCustomization) for more information.

### UI

You can customize how the GUI `Queue` looks as much as you'd like. Some properties should not be edited to keep the queue system working.

<Accordion title="Do not change:" defaultOpen icon="x" iconType="solid">
  - The parent of UI elements. Make sure the GUI titled "Queue" is always in StarterGui
  - The name of UI elements
  - Any scripts
  - Whether the UI is enabled
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do change:" icon="check" iconType="solid">
  - Fonts
  - TextColors
  - Position
  - Size
  - BackgroundColors
  - Stroke
  - UICorner radius
  - Text (May not reflect in actual gameplay)
  - Background Transparency
  - TextTransparency
  - Visibility
</Accordion>

### 3D queue

The 3D queue is the start part and the join part as well as any other parts, models, or meshes that add to the look of the queue. What you can change is similar, but still different from UI.

<Check>
  As long as you pass the start part and the join part in the `Setup` function, you can change things like Parents and Names.
</Check>

<Accordion title="Do not change:" defaultOpen icon="x" iconType="solid">
  - Any scripts
  - CanTouch (Must be on)
  - CanCollide (Must be off)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do change:" icon="check" iconType="solid">
  - Parents
  - Names
  - Position
  - Size
  - Orientation
  - Colors
  - Transparency
  - Shape
  - Reflectance

# Functions

<Warning>
  The queue module will be parented to `ServerScriptService` upon server creation. Do not require the module from its original location.
</Warning>

The queue system comes with a ready-made line, but you might not find that it is completely useful for your experience. For example, you might want to create an admin panel that makes people join/leave the queue. In that case, you can use the module which is made to integrate directly into your scripts. Make sure you know what you're doing before you start. Here is a document explaining how to use Modules.
