<Info>
  Make sure you have an updated version of the system. See [\*\*Buying](/Buying) to buy and update your system.
</Info>

The queue system comes with a ready-made line, but you might not find that it is completely useful for your experience. For example, you might want to create an admin panel that makes people join/leave the queue. In that case, you can use the module which is made to integrate directly into your scripts.
