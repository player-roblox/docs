# Getting Started

The queue system comes with a singular queue along with a leave part and a queue gui with the spot the player is in and a leave button. Make sure you follow the preparation step below.

## Setup

<Danger>
  Important\! Not doing this will break your system\!
</Danger>

After you add the model, you will need to drag the gui named `ScreenGui `to` PlayerGui`. Everything else will work on its own. Make sure not to change the parent of everything else unless you want to get rid of the default system.

## Deleting the ready-made queue

The system has a ready-made queue which is all in the folder titled `queues` under the Module titled `queue`. To delete the ready-made system, simply delete the folder titled `queues.`

<Danger>
  Make sure you delete the entire folder titled queues. Not deleting it can cause errors.
</Danger>

## Creating more queues

To create a new queue in the ready-made system, just clone the existing clone titled `queue1` and change the clone's name. You can move it in any direction you please.

<Warning>
  Creating a queue with an existing name will cause an error and your new queue will not work.
</Warning>

# Functions

The queue system comes with a ready-made line, but you might not find that it is completely useful for your experience. For example, you might want to create an admin panel that makes people join/leave the queue. In that case, you can use the module which is made to integrate directly into your scripts. Make sure you know what you're doing before you start. Here is a document explaining how to use Modules.
